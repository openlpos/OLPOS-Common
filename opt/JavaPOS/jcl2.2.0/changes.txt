#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in 2.1.0-RC1 since 2.0.1 release
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A) Architecture/Design modifications/improvements
B) Core classes/interfaces changes
   0.- Added a new XML populator to load/save using Xerces2 SAX parser.  This new
       parser uses XML schema defined in jpos/res/jcl.xsd.  A sample jpos-schema.xml
       file is provided as an example XML file that uses the schema [IBM]
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
   0.- The editor will now save its editor.config file in a new directory located:
       <user.home>/.jcl
       this directory gets created if necessary [IBM]
   1.- Fixed bug #1882---when resetting editor preferences, default setting were
       not in effect after restarting editor [IBM]
   2.- Fixed bug #2828---Scale device not added [IBM/Fujitsu]
   3.- Added a.6 and 1.7 as a choice for jposVersion and added new 1.6 and 1.7 devices: 
       PointCardRW, CheckScanner and MotionSensor [IBM]
   4.- Fixed bug #1888---if user selects a bad XML or serialized file to merge then they
       are presented with an error and sent back to select a good XML or serialized file. [IBM]
   5.- Fixed bug #1886---added option to allow user to "save as" the JposEntryRegistry 
       contents [IBM]
D) Other changes/additions
   0.- Streamlined the build "src" and "test".  Now, build.xml resides in
       the root install dir and "src" and "test" are at the same level.  The build.xml
       file got updated to use the new structure.  This new structure helps the JCL
       code to be added to CVS more easily. [IBM]
   1.- Added a jpos.util.tracing package with an improved tracing facility [IBM]
   2.- Returned bug #1894 since could not reproduce [IBM]
   3.- Added better tracing to various of the core classes.  This tracing is
       using the new jpos.util.tracing classes and can be switched on for all
       classes or for specific classes.  See jpos.res.jcl.properties file. [IBM]
   4.- Added much documentation and info to the jpos/res/jpos.properties
       file.  This explains all the different properties and how they can
       be used to enable/disable various aspects of the JCL [IBM]
   5.- The build will now create lib/jpos15.jar, lib/jpos16.jar and lib/jpos17.jar
       if the appropriate JPOS_CONTROLS1<5/6/7>_HOME are defined to point to the
       root directory where the JavaPOS 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 controls are located.  These
       are expected to have the following directories: src, test, bin and lib.
       src == all the JavaPOS controls source
       test == any JUnit test sources
       bin == all the .class output from the compiled src and test
       lib == the JAR files
       I have included sample ANT build.xml files that I use to create the
       JavaPOS controls on my system.  They are under the "controls" directory.
       Follow the README-controls for details. [IBM]
   6.- The JCL is now license under the Common Public License (CPL).  Reference to
       that license is added to all source files and README files [IBM]
   7.- Updated the HTML documentation to reflect recent changes [IBM]
   8.- A few more JUnit UTs were added and they all can be ran using:
       % ant test
       This assumes that JUnit1.7 is installed and setup on your system [IBM]
   9.-

# Changes in 2.0.1 since 2.0.0 release
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Architecture/Design modifications/improvements
B) Core classes/interfaces changes
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
D) Other changes/additions
   0.- Fix problem in XercesRegPopulator that stopped it from dynamically extracting
       the jcl.dtd file from a JAR file and creating and deleting it as needed for
       XML entries parsing.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in 2.0.0 since 2.0.0 RC2 release
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Architecture/Design modifications/improvements
   0.- Support for properties of different types then String.  The allowed 
       types are restricted now using the XML populator to the Java primitive
       wrapper classes (i.e. Integer, Long, ...).  String is the default type
       NOTE: though only these types are supported in the default XML populator
       since the JposEntry and JposEntry.Prop interfaces support any serializable
       object as the value of a property, it is conceivable that other types will
       be allowed for the default populator as well as custom populators [IBM]
   
B) Core classes/interfaces changes
   0.- Added a Parallel interface as a busType [IBM suggested by NCR]
   1.- Added "1.6" as a valid constant for jposVersion property [IBM]
   2.- Fixed slight bug whereby jpos.xml was not being found in CLASSPATH
       different then current directory when multiple populators are used [IBM]
   3.- Added support for typed properties to be specified in the XML file with XML 
       populator this results in adding the attribute type to the DTD <prop> element 
       and modifying the XercesRegPopulator to correctly add properties of 
       appropriate types.  Only type supported now (may change in future) are all the 
       wrapper primitive types (i.e. Integer, Long, ...) and String is the default
       type.  See also change 4 and 5 (below) [IBM]
   4.- Added methods to JposEntry interface and the JposEntry.Prop interface
       that accomodate properties with types [IBM]
   5.- Implemented new methods and support for properties with type in the JposEntry 
       and JposEntry.Prop interfaces [IBM]
   6.- Added the following exception classes JposConfigException and JposLoaderException
       deriving from JposException [IBM]
   7.- Added methods in the JposEntryUtility to support property types [IBM]
   8.- Added constants in JposEntryConst to support property types [IBM]
   
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
   0.- Editor version in the About dialog now corresponds to the JCL release version [IBM]
   1.- Removed the "Edit" -> "Modify" sub-menu since it used the "old" editor dialog [IBM]
   2.- Added types for property in the vendor properties tab page [IBM]
   3.- When removing vendor property always confirm [IBM]
   4.- Added a way to reset the editor configuration info [IBM]
   5.- Removed "JCL 1.2" option from editor [IBM]
   6.- Disallow adding properties with empty names [IBM]
   7.- Disallow changing the logicalName of a property.  Must Delete or Copy entire entry [IBM]
   8.- Indicate a success message if XML/CFG file saved correctly in merger [IBM]
   9.- All file chooser now correctly show file filter [IBM]
   10.- Vendor properties values of integer type are shown in hex if this is selected in config [IBM]
   11.- "Save as..." automatically adds extension if user does not add it themselves [IBM]
   12.- Add a checkbox in "Copy..." JposEntry that auto delete previous entry [IBM]
   13. If user choose to reset config then show dialog to indicate that restart of editor is required [IBM]
   
D) Other changes/additions
   0.- Improved HTML documentation [IBM]
   1.- Updated JCL White Paper [IBM]
   2.- Updated Linux/UNIX "editor" script to better launch the editor in these environments
      [Eric Richardson <eric@milagrosoft.com>]
   4.- Installation now also includes the JUnit (http://www.junit.org) tests for the JCL.
       You can run the tests by extracting the test classes in the "<JCL_HOME>src/test"
       directory and either:
       a) using Apache Ant with:
            %ant -buildfile build_jcl.xml test
       b) using JUnit directly.  For instance using the JUnit text TestRunner assuming both
       <JCL_HOME>/src and <JCL_HOME>/src/test are in your CLASSAPTH issuing the following 
       command in the <JCL_HOME>/src/test directory:
            %java junit.textui.TestRunner jpos.AllTests
       PS: all tests should run successfully.  If any tests fails please submit a bug report
       to E. Michael Maximilien at maxim@us.ibm.com
   5.- In the sample TestAppFrame set the logigalName JTextField with the test logical name
       that is set by default in the JCL registry "com.xyz.MyLD" this can be used to verify
       that the JCL installation is working since the sample code implements a virtual LineDisplay
       service that shows a Swing LineDisplay that can display text and clear text

C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
   
   0.- Fix bug when switching from standard props view to other tabs and no entry selected [IBM]
   1.- Better defaults for RS232 properties (see RS232Const for defaults) [IBM]
   2.- Editor now remembers the last location where file was loaded or saved [IBM]
   2.- Vendor properties were not being cleared if no entry selected or new file loaded [IBM]

   1.- Corrected JAR files so that they include jpos.properties and DTD files [IBM]

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in 2.0.0 RC1 since 1.3 beta 1 release
# The changes are listed under its appropriate category (i.e. core classes/
# interfaces, ...) a short description is provided and also the originator or requestor
# of that change is listed in square brackets  (i.e. [Datafit])
# NOTE: when methods/instance are added to a class or interface then UML notation is

# where <access> == + (for public), - (for private), # (for protected) and nothing for package
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Architecture/Design modifications/improvements
   
   0.- Added multi-populator support to better support multi-vendor solutions.  You can
       now specify mutiple populator class via the multi-property named: 
       jpos.config.populator.class.n <value>
       where n = 0, 1, 2, ... and 
       jpos.config.populator.file.n = <value>
       The n value for the file matches the populator class specified. [IBM]
   
B) Core classes/interfaces changes
   
   0.- Added JposEntry.modifyPropertyValue method and also in the SimpleEntry class.  This
       does not change the serialVersionUID of the class so there are not compatibility
       concerns [IBM]
       
   1.- Added multi-property support that is you can specify multiple related properties
       like <propName>.<n> = <value> where n = 0, 1, ...  This results is to support 
       mulitple populator support.  This resulted in adding a core inner interface 
       JposProperties.MultiProperty methods and various a couple methods in the outer
       interface [IBM]
       
   2.- Added getClassName():String and getUniqueKey():String to JposRegPopulator interface
       and subsequently to implementing classes.  This is needed for multiple populator 
       support [IBM]
   
   3.- Moved all JposProperties constants to a separate interface called JposPropertiesConst
       JposProperties now extends JposPropertiesConst [IBM]
       
   4.- Added 2 new multi-property base name constants in JposPropertiesConst called [IBM]:
       + JPOS_CONFIG_POPULATOR_CLASS_MULTIPROP_NAME : String = "jpos.config.populator.class"
       + JPOS_CONFIG_POPULATOR_FILE_MULTIPROP_NAME : String = "jpos.config.populator.file"
       Added constant PROP_NAME_ARRAY that keeps all property names
   
   5.- To support multiple populator added following to JposEntry and SimpleEntry [IBM]:
       a) + JposEntry::getRegPopulator() : JposRegPopulator
       b) + Transient JposRegPopulator field
       c) + SimpleEntry::SimpleEntry() and SimpleEntry::SimpleEntry( pop : JposRegPopulator )
       d) SimpleEntry::setRegPopulator( JposRegPopulator pop ):void
       e) AbstractRegPopulator::AbstractRegPopulator( String id ) { this affects all subclasses
          of AsbtractRegPopulator that is SimpleRegPopulator, XercesRegPopulator, 
      SimpleXmlRegPopulator which now also have a 1-arg ctor and the no-arg ctor need to
      pass the default ID to the superclass ctor.
   
   6.- SimpleXmlRegPopulator implements XmlRegPopulator as it should have [IBM]
   
   7.- Removed deprecated methods in SimpleServiceManager (set/getEntriesFileName) [IBM]
   
   8.- Added following methods (if interface then also implementing classes):
    a) JposEntry::getLogicalName():String
    b) SimpleEntryRegistry::toString():String
    c) JposEntryRegistry::addJposEntry( e:JposEntry ):void

   9.- Added toString() method to DefaultProperties class and changed implementation
       of the JposPropertiesViewer class to use that method [IBM]
   
   10.- Added method JposServiceManager::reloadEntryRegistry():void that reloads
        the populators and registry at runtime.  Useful if properties or populator
    files change at runtime [IBM]
       
        
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes

   0.- Added PropertiesEditor amd PropertiesEditorFrame class as a simple application
       that allows you to edit the jpos.properties file [IBM]
   
D) Other changes/additions
 
   0.- jpos.util.JposPropertiesViewer application now list properties sorting them 
       by name [IBM]
   
E) JCL profile details

   0.- Started adding JCL profile support in package jpos.profile.  Various interfaces
       and classes are added defining the JCL profile object model, XML DTD and files.
       This is not yet complete [IBM]

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in 1.2 since 1.2 RC1 and RC2 release
# The changes are listed under its appropriate category (i.e. core classes/
# interfaces, ...) a short description is provided and also the originator or requestor
# of that change is listed in square brackets  (i.e. [Datafit])
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Architecture/Design modifications/improvements
   None

B) Core classes/interfaces changes
   1.- Added overloaded save and load methods in the RegPopulator interface
       This change should not adversly affect existing JCL implementations. [IBM]
   2.- Fix a bug in the XercesRegPopulator and AbsractRegPopulator which caused 
       the entries to be cleared if you loaded a new populator file. [IBM]
   3.- XercesregPopulator now automatically extract jpos/res/jcl.dtd if the DTD is
       not present otherwise uses the one present.  Also if the DTD was extracted it
       is removed automatically. [IBM]
   4.- SimpleEntry now contains a serialVersionUID constant for backward compatibility
       of serialized entries with future releases. [Wincore-Nirxdorff]
        
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
   None, since RC2.

D) Other changes/additions
   1.- The JCL is now release as an InstallShield for Java setup.class.  Tested under
       Linux and Win32 fine.  Solaris test worked for RC2 release. [IBM]

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in 1.2.0 RC1 since 1.2.0 EA3 release
# The changes are listed under its appropriate category (i.e. core classes/
# interfaces, ...) a short description is provided and also the originator or requestor
# of that change is listed in square brackets  (i.e. [Datafit])
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Architecture/Design modifications/improvements
   None

B) Core classes/interfaces changes
   None
        
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
   Various improvements and bug fixes:
   1.- 

D) Other changes/additions
   1.- The jpos.util.DefaultProperties file is now changed to load the jpos.properties
       file using the ClassLoader.getSystemResourceAsStream instead of using the 
       ResourceBundle class.  This makes it possible for the jpos.properties to be
       located in the system directory OR a Zip/JAR file.  [IBM]
   2.- Changed the com.xyz.jpos.XyzJposServiceInstanceFactory and com.xyz.jpos.DeviceService
       classes so that the factory passes the JposEntry to the DeviceService class for
       further intialization. [IBM]
   3.- Improved the JCL installation by using a self-install .class file using InstallShield
       for Java 3.0. [IBM]

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in 1.2.0 EA3 since 1.2.0 EA2 release
# The changes are listed under its appropriate category (i.e. core classes/
# interfaces, ...) a short description is provided and also the originator or requestor
# of that change is listed in square brackets  (i.e. [Datafit])
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) Architecture/Design modifications/improvements
    None

B) Core classes/interfaces changes
    None
        
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
    None

D) Other changes/additions
   1.- Was using the Vector.add method in XercesRegPopulator and SimpleRegPopulator.  The
       Vector.add method was added in Java 2 and is not compatible with Java 1.1.  Reverted
       to make maintain compatibility and using Vector.addElement now... [IBM]
   2.- Made necessary changes in jpos.config.simple.xml package to support the Xerces 1.0.3 release [IBM-Japan]
       a) Change the XercesRegPopulator.serializeDocument method to not use the XMLSerializer.init 
          method call and instead pass the PrintWriter and OutputFormater objects in its ctor
   3.- To maintain compatibility with previous releases, change default in the jpos.properties to:
       a) Set tracing to OFF
       b) Set the default populator to be the SimpleRegPopulator instead of the XML populator
       NOTE: these defaults are subject to change, every user should set there own defaults
             by editing the properties file [IBM]
   4.- Added JavaDOC comment to XercesRegPopulator and changed createEmptyDocument signature to
       not expect a Document object since it never used that parameter [IBM]

    1.- Added a way to dynamically change the properties of the "jpos.config/loader"
        via the Java properties file and resource mechanism.  This allows easier 
        configuration/customization without direct code modification.  Can define
        various properties to customize the "jpos.config/loader.  If the properties
        file is cannot be loaded, is incorrect or not present then the defaults
        Simple implementation is used.  See change B-1.  [IBM]
    2.- Added support for customizing the populator and populator file or URL. [IBM]
    3.- Created an XML DTD and XML populator that uses the Apache Xerces-J DOM API [IBM]

B) Core classes/interfaces changes
    1.- The JposServiceLoader will load the "jpos.properties" file in the "res"
        directory to read in Java properties for the JavaPOS.  The "jpos.config.
        serviceInstanceFactoryClass" property can be defined there. [IBM]
        NOTE: to keep backward compatibility if the property is defined by running
        java -D<propName>=<propValue> <className> then this System property 
        overrides any property defined in the "jpos.properties" file.  Also if
        the "jpos.properties" file is not found, could not be loaded and or
        is incorrect then the loader defaults to the Simple implementation.
        This .properties file is now located "jpos\res" directory. [IBM]
    2.- Allow dynamic adding/removing of JposEntry in the JposEntryRegistry [IBM/Datafit]
    3.- Added JposProperties and DefaultProperties interface and class to encapsulate
        all properties related operations.  These are added in the jpos.util package [IBM]
    4.- Deprecated various ctor and methods in SimpleServiceManager and SimpleEntryRegistry 
        please see the JavaDOC for details. [IBM]
    5.- The JposEntryRegistry now has a load/save and needs to return a valid JposRegPopulator
        which needs to be used to load/save the entries. [IBM/JavaPOS-J]
    6.- Added a simple application to indicate the current JCL version.  Run using:
                    %java jpos.loader.Version
                    OR
                    %java jpos.config.Version
        The output should be similar to:
                    JavaPOS jpos.config/loader (JCL) version 1.2.0
    7.- Added a JposRegPopulator interface to search/load/save the JposRegistry.  With this 
        infrastructure you can select different populator implementation like the default 
        looks for jpos.cfg in classpath then inside root of all JAR/Zip files.  A new property
        is defined in the jpos.properties file to control this: 
                jpos.config.regPopulatorClass = jpos.config.simple.SimpleRegPopulator
        NOTE: by default if this property is not defined then the SimpleRegPopulator is used. [IBM]
    8.- The default populator can now load the configuration information from a jpos.cfg file
        that is in a JAR or Zip file.  [Datafit]
        NOTE: since the JAR/Zip files are in use they cannot be modified so saving the registry
              will generate an error.
    9.- Added 2 properties called: jpos.config.populatorFile and jpos.config.populatorFileURL
        Defined one of them to force the populator to get the entries from the file or URL specified.
        NOTE: if both are defined then the "jpos.config.populatorFile" value is used.  Also
              using the "jpos.config.populatorFileURL" one can point to local files or JAR using the 
              the "file" protocol (Java 1.1 and 2) and "jar" protocol (Java 2 only). [IBM]
    10.- Added a populator to load/save the entries in XML according to the XML DTD for JposEntry 
         defined in the "jpos/res/jcl.dtd" file.  A sample valid "jcl.xml" XML file is provided.
         To use the XML populator you MUST define the populator file or URL. More details on this 
         populator be provided in the readme. Note this populator requires that all of the 
         required JavaPOS properties be defined.  [IBM]
    11.- Added a simple tracing facility in the jpos.util package.  Turn it on and off by using
         the jpos.properties file [IBM]
         
    12.- In class SimpleRegPopulator changed:
                  new ObjectInputStream( new FileInputStream... to
                  new ObjectInputStream( new BufferedInputStream( new FileInputStream...
         This buffering could improve load performance on some system... [IBM]
    13.- Added all the required property names constants in the JposEntry interface [IBM]
        
C) Editor classes/interfaces changes
    1.- Added setDefaultFrameCloseOperation/setFrameVisible static methods in
        class JposEntryEditor to allow the editor to be embedded into a Java app
        (otherwise exiting the editor would exit the JVM). [IBM]
    2.- Change the AboutDialog to reflect version number and added Java logo [IBM]
    3.- Added "Edit" -> "Look and Feel" -> "Java LnF"/"Native LnF" menu item to 
        allow dynamic changes of the current LnF. [Datafit]
    4.- Message area (at bottom of frame) scroll down when text is outputed. [IBM]
    5.- Increase the MainFrame default width by about 2% to 705 pixel. [IBM]
    6.- Increase size of JTextField inn the JposEntryViewPanel class and set
        the tooltip-text of all text fields to text value if value length is
        bigger then the text field number of columns. [IBM]

D) Other changes/additions
    1.- Added JavaDOC comments on all class/method/interface. [IBM]
    2.- Change indentation to 4 space. [IBM]
    3.- Generate JavaDOC HTML documentation for the core/simple/editor classes
        and interfaces. [IBM]
    4.- Run spell-check on all code comments. [IBM]
    5.- Improve readme, changes etc.. doc to make it easy for first time users. [IBM/Other]
    6.- Changed all legal-header to reflect IBM's new legal-header proposal [IBM]
